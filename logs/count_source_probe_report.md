## Interpretation

No sampled alternate endpoint exposed a parseable play-count field in this run. This does not prove the source is absent everywhere; it narrows the next search toward either broader prefix CDX probes, archived JavaScript behavior, or external list pages rather than the already-tested game-page placeholders.

## Retry Note

13 CDX lookups failed during this run, so dry endpoints with failed status should be retried later before being treated as durable absences.
